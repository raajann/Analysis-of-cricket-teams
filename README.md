# Tableau-Project

I am a fan of the sport cricket ever since 2007. However, I wanted to know how teams performed before 2007. The goal of this project is to identify the strongest cricket team.

I acquired a dataset from kaggle.com. 

The contents of the repository include a Exploratory Visual Analysis (EVA) Paper where I analyzed the importance of toss in cricket, presentation slides, and the tableau workbook containing the visual data analysis I did to arrive at the goal of this project.

Please find the link to my presentation where I analyze the dataset using tableau and determine the strongest team.
